## Progress Bars

Make progress bars unambiguous by referring to a single, specific task. For example, use progress bars to indicate the status of lengthy processes like file transfers and encoding. Do not use progress bars to compound the progress of different types of action.

* **Good Example**: Installation progress in AppCenter
* **Bad Example**: Combined progress of downloading an album, burning a CD, and syncing a mobile device in a music app

## Badges

A badge shows a count of actionable items managed by your app. Its purpose is to inform the user that there are items that require user attention or action without being obtrusive. This is a passive notification. A badge should not show totals or rarely changing counters. If the badge is not easily dismissed when the user views your app, it is likely that this is not a good use of a badge.

* **Good Example**: Unread messages in a mail app
* **Bad Example**: Total number of photos in a photo library
