# User Workflow

Visible design is a large part of the user experience, but so is the user's workflow, or how they interact with an app. In this section, we cover a few important steps of a typical workflow:

* [First Launch Experience](first-launch-experience.md): What the user sees the first time they use your app
* [Normal Launch](normal-launch.md): What happens when opening your app on a day-to-day basis
* [Always Provide an Undo](always-provide-an-undo.md): Help users be faster and more confident
* [Always Saved](always-saved.md): Bringing the desktop in line with modern expectations
* [Closing](closing.md): What happens when closing your app
* [Background Tasks](background-tasks.md): How your app manages to do things invisibly in the background
