# Code Reviews

Code reviews play a crucial role in the elementary OS development process: Having other people verifying your code improves the overall code quality - and those reviews serve an even bigger purpose: They provide an opportunity for us to learn from each other. This guide tries to minimize the barrier for code reviews by providing a common ground of best practices and philosophies which proved to be useful over the years.

Remember: The roles of a developer and a reviewer are not exclusive - you can be both. We highly encourage you to do both, because this leads to more diverse reviews which help us to improve the overall user experience of elementary. So please make yourself familiar with the guidelines for [developers](prepare-code-for-review.md) as well as for [reviewers](reviewing-code.md).
